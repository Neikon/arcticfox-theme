# arcticfox theme

a theme for Firefox (and Sidebery, because it fancy) to make it look and somewhat behave like Arc

---

⚠️ **btw**

this theme is:
- buggy in some places
- only tested in firefox 119 on linux
- best used with the [sidebery extension](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery)
- not guaranteed to be 100% working out of the box, you might need to tweak it some
